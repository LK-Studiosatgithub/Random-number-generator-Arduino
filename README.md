Generating "real" random numbers using Arduino (UNO)

Even if no hardware is connected with the analog pins of the arduino you can measure a tiny voltage -the static electricity. This electricity varies very often an fast. So its a great base for generating unpredictable (â†’strong) random numbers. I will show you how to measure this electricty and how to send the numbers trough the serial line to a PC.
